		<h2>Reporting</h2>

		<p>If you are being harassed by a member of Gamer Anonymous, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

		<p>This code of conduct applies to Gamer Anonymous spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Gamer Anonymous outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Gamer Anonymous members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Gamer Anonymous based on their past behaviour, including behaviour outside Gamer Anonymous spaces and behaviour towards people who are not in Gamer Anonymous.</p>

		<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

		<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we&rsquo;ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Gamer Anonymous members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
