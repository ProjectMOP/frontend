## Welcome to repository for the Gamer Anonymous Website!

If you've stumbled across this repository and don't know who we are, check out our [main website](http://gameranonymous.com/). 

From the website:

> Gamer Anonymous is a co-operative of people who want to create a nicer, more inclusive gaming community.

> We want to provide a community environment including Forums, IRC chatrooms, TeamSpeak servers, Casting, e-sports tournaments and more.

The Gamer Anonymous community is one where everyone is encouraged to contribute to it. You can help the website in many ways: programming, documentation, discussion and more.

### But _how_ exactly do I take part?

Take a look at the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gameranonymous/frontend/issues) of this repository, to see what we need help on. Feel free to add your own too.

For any issues that someone marked "_enhancement_" and/or "_bug_", they are likely to need some programming input. If you can help then we encourage you to "fork the repository" add your own code and submit a "pull request" which someone will merge (incorporate) into the Gamer Anonymous website if accepted!

Finally; if you see an issue marked "_question_", we encourage you to look within and take part in the discussion. We like to make our decisions together.


### Sounds great, but what is forking and what are pull requests?

These are terms used on GitHub to state different ways of working with code.
We recommend taking a look at the following GitHub guides: [Forking a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) & [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, that's ok! Check out GitHub and CodeSchool's [15 minute interactive tutorial on Git](try.github.io). If you'd like something more in-depth and challenging, check out [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).

### Most Importantly...

Have fun! Suggest new things, engage in discussion and play games with us. You can find us on the [#gameranonymous IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?nick=guest&channels=#gameranonymous) and you can contact some of the main contributors to Gamer Anonymous [here](http://gameranonymous.com/maintainers.html). If you need a helping hand, don't hesitate to ask.
